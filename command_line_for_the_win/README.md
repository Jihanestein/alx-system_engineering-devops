very fun project about using command-line
Here are the steps i followed

Take the screenshots of the completed levels as mentioned in the general requirements.
Copied and pasted the path of the png in the files 
if you open the files you will see the link of the path ( i have ios so that the path of the pnp i got )
you can copy and past the link and you see the png 

i had fun doing this task didnt want it to finish 

also im trying the sftp step, i got access to sftp but once i copy th path using the "put" command it doesnt work , will do my best to make it work ...meanwhile you can check the png's in the files 

Thank you ;)
